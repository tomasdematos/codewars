They tend to blur all the letters together and scream at people.</p><p>At long last, we need a way to unscramble what these pirates are saying.</p><p>Write a function that will accept a jumble of letters as well as a dictionary, and output a list of words that the pirate might have meant.</p><p>For example:</p><pre><code>grabscrab( "ortsp", ["sport", "parrot", "ports", "matey"] )</code></pre><p>Should return <code>["sport", "ports"]</code>.</p><p>Return matches in the same order as in the dictionary. Return an empty array if there are no matches.</p><p>Good luck!</p>
