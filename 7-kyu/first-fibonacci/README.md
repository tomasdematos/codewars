So <code>0 + 1 = 1</code>, <code>1 + 1 = 2</code>, <code>1 + 2 = 3</code>, <code>2 + 3 = 5</code>, etc.</p><h3 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h3><p>Your challenge is, given two numbers in a Fibonacci-like sequence (where the next number is found by adding the two previous numbers), to find the lowest possible non-negative numbers that the sequence originates from. For example, if you are given the numbers <code>398</code> and <code>644</code>, which come from this sequence:</p><pre><code>2, 6, 8, 14, 22, 36, 58, 94, 152, 246, 398, 644</code></pre><p>Then you would return <code>2</code> and <code>6</code>, as they are the numbers which started the sequence. </p><p>Note that <code>8</code> and <code>14</code>, while they also start a sequence containing <code>398</code> and <code>644</code>, are not correct as they are not the <strong>lowest possible</strong> sequence start.</p><h3 id="note">Note</h3><ul><li>For the purposes of this puzzle, Fibonacci-like sequences don't decrease. This means that the following sequence is not considered Fibonacci-like, and <code>4</code> and <code>2</code> are NOT solutions to the puzzle:  <pre><code>4, 2, 6, 8, 14, 22, 36, 58, 94, 152, 246, 398, 644</code></pre></li></ul><h3 id="good-luck">Good luck!</h3>
